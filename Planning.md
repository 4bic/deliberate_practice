* [Software Development Skills For Data Scientists]

    * Writing modular, reusable code
    * Documenting / Commenting
    * Version Control - Git
    * Testing
    * Logging

## Estimate Time Required To Achieve Goal

I will give myself the whole May to July 2018 to work on this goal. It seems like a long time, but effectively, I have only 12 weeks left (as of 01-05-2018).

**Timeframe**:
*   Efficiently code in python end of July.
*   One ongoing big project touching different stacks in Python by the end of October 2018.
